# Mod Obfuscation & Encryption

Protect your mods from unauthorized extraction and redistribution.

## AES-256 Encryption

Repak X supports AES-256 encryption for mod bundles, making it impossible to extract assets without the correct key.

## Asset Obfuscation

Beyond encryption, Repak X can obfuscate asset structures to block common extraction tools from reading your mod files.

## How It Works

1. Toggle encryption/obfuscation in the **install panel** when installing a mod, or when **updating/replacing** an existing mod
2. Repak X applies AES-256 encryption during the packing process
3. The encrypted mod blocks common extraction tools from reading your mod files
