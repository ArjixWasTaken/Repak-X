# Mod Sharing

Share mods with others using Repak X's built-in sharing system.

## How It Works

Repak X packages your selected mods into a bundle, uploads it to a file host, and generates a **connection string** that you can share with others.

1. Select the mod(s) you want to share
2. Set a name, description, and optionally your creator name
3. Repak X zips the mod files and uploads them
4. A connection string is generated — share it with others

## Receiving Mods

1. Get a connection string from another Repak X user
2. Paste it into Repak X's receive panel
3. The mods are downloaded and extracted to your mod directory
