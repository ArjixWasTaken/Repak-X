# Global Clash Detection

Resolve mod conflicts with Repak X's priority-based clash detection system.

## How It Works

When two or more mods modify the same game asset, Repak X detects the conflict and alerts you. You can then choose which mod takes priority using the priority selector.

## Priority System

- Each mod has a priority level
- Higher-priority mods override lower-priority ones when conflicts occur
- You can adjust priorities at any time from the mod management interface
