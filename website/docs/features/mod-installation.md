# Mod Installation

Repak X provides a powerful and flexible mod installation system.

## Install Panel

The install panel gives you per-mod control over:

- **Custom name** — rename mods for easier organization
- **Tags** — add searchable tags
- **Folder destination** — choose where the mod gets installed
- **Compression** — toggle Oodle compression for IO Store bundles
- **Format toggle** — switch between Legacy PAK and IO Store
- **Repak toggle** — enable/disable repacking

## Drag & Drop

Simply drag files or folders onto the Repak X window to begin installation. Supported formats include:

- `.pak` files
- `.uasset` / `.umap` files
- Folders containing mod assets
- Archive files (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`)

## Multiple Mod Installation

Install several mods at once — each with its own settings in the install panel.

## Parallel Processing

Toggle between **Normal** (50% thread usage) and **Boost** (75% thread usage) modes for faster installations.
