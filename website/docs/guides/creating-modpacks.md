# Sharing Mods

Learn how to share mods with other Repak X users.

## How Sharing Works

Repak X's sharing system uploads your mod files to a file host and generates a connection string. Share the connection string with anyone — they paste it into Repak X to download the mods directly.

## Sharing Your Mods

1. Open Repak X
2. Select the mod(s) you want to share
3. Choose the **Share** option
4. Enter a name and description for the mod pack
5. Repak X uploads the files and gives you a connection string
6. Send the connection string to other users

## Receiving Shared Mods

1. Get a connection string from another Repak X user
2. Open the receive panel in Repak X
3. Paste the connection string
4. The mods will be downloaded and extracted automatically
